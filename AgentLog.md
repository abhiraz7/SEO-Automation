- `app/main.py` — FastAPI app entry
- Templates: base.html, index.html, project_detail.html, page_detail.html, partials/sidebar.html, partials/pages_table.html

**Phase 2 — SEO Audit (V1.5)**: COMPLETE

## 2026-06-24 — Session: Revert to SQLite + Supabase stub layer

### What Changed
- `app/database.py` — reverted to `sqlite:///seo_automation.db`; marked the exact line to swap for PostgreSQL when ready
- `app/supabase_client.py` — new: Supabase integration stub for learning datasets (`acceptance_dataset`, `judge_dataset`, `visibility_dataset`, `memory_dataset`); all functions are silent no-ops until `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_KEY` env vars are set
- `requirements.txt` — `psycopg2-binary` kept (harmless, needed for future PostgreSQL migration)

### Why
Supabase `t4g.nano` exposes only an IPv6 direct connection; this Windows machine has no IPv6 internet. The IPv4 pooler (`aws-0-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com`) rejected the project tenant. Blocked at network level, not a code issue. Will migrate after core product is stable.

### Status
- Phase 1 Crawl Engine: COMPLETE
- Phase 2 SEO Audit: COMPLETE
- Phase 3 AI Suggestions: NEXT

### Next
Add `Suggestion` model to `models.py` → `app/claude.py` for Claude API → generate 5 suggestions per issue → store → display on `page_detail.html`

---

## 2026-06-25 — Session: Phase 3 — AI Suggestions

### What Changed
- `app/models.py` — added `Suggestion` table (project_id, page_id, issue_id, content, rank); added `suggestions` relationship to `Issue`; fixed `datetime.utcnow` deprecation → `_utcnow()` using `timezone.utc`
- `app/claude.py` — new: Claude API integration using `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`; lazy client init; generates exactly 5 ranked suggestions per issue
- `app/routes/suggestions.py` — new: POST `/projects/{project_id}/pages/{page_id}/issues/{issue_id}/suggest`; clears old suggestions, calls Claude, stores 5 new ones, redirects back
- `app/main.py` — wired `suggestions.router`; added `load_dotenv()` on startup
- `app/templates/page_detail.html` — issues table replaced with expandable issue cards; each card has "Get Suggestions" button; ranked suggestions display inline below the issue
- `requirements.txt` — added `anthropic`, `python-dotenv`

### Status
- Phase 1 Crawl Engine: COMPLETE
- Phase 2 SEO Audit: COMPLETE
- Phase 3 AI Suggestions: COMPLETE
- Phase 4 Rule Validation: NEXT

### Next
Add `app/validator.py` — validate each suggestion against length, keyword presence, uniqueness, readability rules before storing; show pass/fail badges on suggestion cards in `page_detail.html`
